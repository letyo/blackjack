<p>The rules of the life...uhmm..sorry...I wanna say blackjack</p>

<h2>Game overview</h2>

<p>The objective of the game of Blackjack is to achieve as close a value to 21 as possible, with 2 or more cards, and beat the dealer’s score; if the dealer’s score is above 21 then all remaining hands are winners. The first 2 cards can be split or doubled, where the rules allow.   The game has an engaging pace, an element of skill and is played with 1 deck (as default, but it can be modify in the options menu from 1 to 20) of cards which are shuffled at the start of every new game, but not before every deal (as default it is shuffled if the 65 % of the deck(s) is already used, but it can be modify in the options menu).</p>
<p>The cards drawn from the deck(s) are done so totally randomly.</p>

<h2>The Game  </h2>

    <li>Deal – starts the game; 2 cards will be dealt to the player and 2 cards will be dealt to the dealer, with one card face down.</li>
</ul>

    <li>Money ‐ shows the player’s balance.</li>
    <li>Bet ‐ displays the total bet value per game.</li>
    <li>Win ‐ displays the total paid.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Game play</h3>

<p>Once the initial deal has taken place and all player and dealer cards have been dealt the game will offer game play buttons in accordance with the rules of the game.
If the dealer’s face up card is an Ace or a value of ten, the dealer will check the face down card for Blackjack.</p>
<p>The total value of the cards is displayed; hands that contain Aces display both the low and high value since an Ace has a value of 1 or 11 (apart from when a blackjack is dealt). Where the hand value is 21 with the first 2 cards the phrase Blackjack is displayed.</p>

<h3>Game buttons</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hit – draws another card on the highlighted hand.</li>
    <li>Stand – finishes the hand; draws no further cards and moves on to the next hand or the dealer, depending on the state of play.</li>
    <li>Double – offered once per hand and is available after the first 2 cards have been dealt to the player. Double is available on any 2 cards This bet requires a further bet equal to the initiating bet; chips are placed on the original bet to signify the increase and one further card is drawn. This completes the hand; no further action is possible.</li>
    <li>Split ‐ If the first 2 cards dealt are of the same value and type e.g. 8,8 or 10,10 etc. then a split option is available. Pressing split will cause the cards to separate, a further bet equal to the initiating bet is taken for the newly created hand, and now 2 hands are in play. Further drawing of cards to these hands is possible after this event, except in the case of split Aces where only one card is dealt per split hand. A split is offered once per hand with no re‐splits. Split hands do not qualify for enhanced Blackjack payouts. Doubling is allowed after splits (except for split Aces).</li>
    <li>Bet – at the end of a completed game this option is available. </li>
    <li>Deal - after placing the bet, this option is available. With this is possible to start the game.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Payouts</h3>

<p>Once the player’s hands are complete the dealer will reveal the face down card and continue drawing cards until the value is 17 or greater (it can be changed in options menu to 16 or greater). The dealer must stand on all 17s. The outcomes and payouts are as follows:</p>

<p>Push</p>

<p>A push occurs if:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The player and dealer have hands with the same value.</li>
    <li>A push does not occur in the instance where a Blackjack is against a non Blackjack 21; Blackjack (a 2 card value) is always higher than achieving 21 with more than 2 cards.</li>
