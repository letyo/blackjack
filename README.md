It's a simple blackjack game, wirtten in jQuery and SCSS.

You can choose:
- with how many decks do you want to play
- how big is the penetration (%) (how big part of cards do you wanna use)
- when should the dealer stand (17 or 18)

There is a rules menu, if you don't know them.

It could be improved with:
- it's not possible to split yet
- it is not possible to take back the bet and put another
